          "Slight revision It seems that the below has changed slightly, and Apple now checks which numbers\/emails have been activated per device for sending messages. Therefore, my mobile number on my iPhone can be registered on my iCloud account, and allow me to receive message sent to my mobile number to be received on my iPad. Therefore you can have the conversation appear on multiple devices at once, and switch between them. iMessage will keep these conversations in sync. I disable this by specifying which accounts to be linked to which device when configuring iMessage. To expand on alexmullers answer it uses the Device ID to determine if another device is running iOS 5. This is done during registration, or when iMessage is configured under phone settings. Effectively the Device ID and Apple IDs\/Mobile numbers are stored on the Apple Servers. It checks the Apple servers to determine if a number or email address is registered as an Apple ID and using iOS 5. It will then send the message via the Apple Servers first. It also uses text fallback, so if the other user is not using an iOS device, or iMessage is unavailable or down, or your data connection is down, it will send the message as a text. Text fallback can however be disabled. This does not affect normal texting. On the phone itself iMessages are identified via a blue background, and can show Delivered\/Read for each message. SMS to the same person is still shown in a green background. It also uses the Device ID to determine which device to reply to. I have my email address and phone number configured on my iPhone and on my iPad only my email address. In Example I send a message to my wifes iPad using her email address from my iPhone, she receives it on the iPad, and the reply is sent back to my iPhone. I send a message via my iPad to her email address, the reply is sent back to my iPad, and not my iPhone. She sends a message to my iPhone using my mobile number from the iPad, it comes to my iPhone and bypasses the iPad completely and the reply goes back to her iPad. Its intelligent enough to know where the message came from and where to reply to.",
          "iMessage (Free) iMessage, Apples own messaging platform, can send and receive messages on iOS (5 or later on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch), macOS and watchOS, as long as they are connected to either a Wi-Fi or cellular network (3G). Starting with iOS 10, Messages includes support for third party apps.",
          "iMessage is actually an instant messaging service, like Google Talk or AOL Instant Messenger, except iMessage is made by Apple and is only for Apple products. Only an iPhone with cellular can send SMS messages as well, and can automatically associate phone numbers of registered iMessage users with iMessage accounts, so if you try to use the app to send a text to a phone number registered to an iPhone, it will send an iMessage instead. iPads cannot send SMS messages to non-Apple devices nor an iMessage to a phone number not registered with iMessage from a Wi-Fi-only device. http:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/HT3529",
          "Your iPhone uses the Messages app to send messages to other devices. However, it works a bit differently depending on what device the person you are messaging is using. When you send a Message, the iPhone looks on Apple servers to see if the recipient owns an Apple Device. Remember when you had to register your device with an Apple ID? This was putting your email in the Apple server. It also put your telephone number in the Apple server. If the server finds your recipient in the Apple servers, it automatcially sends a message via the Apple network, therefore not using the SMS network, which might incur charges (depending on your SMS or text message limits). If the Apple server does not find your recipient, then it sends the message via SMS or text messaging, over the carriers system. So, if you send a message to a friend who has an Android phone, the Apple server wont find that device in its database, and will then send the message via regular text messaging service, so the Android phone can receive it. This systems allows you to message anyone, and Apple simply figures out the best way to send the message, whether its via Apples system, which does not incur SMS fees, or via the carriers system, which might incur fees. (most users in the USA have unlimited text messaging plans these days, so this is less than a concern. If you have a limit of 100 messages, you can appreciate how this is a good thing.) OK, now to your question: your email: Messages is NOT sending a message via email. It is simply using the email (which is likely your Apple ID), as an identifier of your device. This lets other Apple users send you a message to either your phone number or email address. This is useful on iPads, iPod Touch, and Macs, who can not send to phone numbers, because they do not have phone service. So, with Messages on your iPhone, someone on their Mac can send you a message, and you can message back!",
          "iMessages dont go through your cell phone provider so they dont necessarily know about them. iMessages go through your network connection so to your provider they look just like any other network\/internet\/browser traffic. If your text messages were from Apple device to Apple device (using iMessage for both sides), its not going to show up on the provider logs. If your text messages were from your iPhone (or other Apple device) to a non-apple device or an Apple device without a network connection but still connected to the cell network, that does go through your cell provider. They will have a log of those messages. You can tell which ones those are because the chat bubble on the Apple device is green instead of blue."
