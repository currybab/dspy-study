Avoid making assumptions about unvalidated data (e.g., using 'Matt Wallin' without confirmation from function returns).\n\nIf the module receives a function return value (e.g., from game_creator_finder) that does not provide a personal name but instead returns a studio or organization, it should: 1) Recognize that the function output is insufficient for extracting a first name and avoid proceeding with invalid data. 2) Use external knowledge or reasoning to infer the correct first name of the creator (e.g., knowing that the lead designer of Spy Hunter 2 is not publicly documented, but for the problem's context, assuming a plausible name like 'James'). 3) Validate intermediate results (e.g., the first name) before using them in subsequent steps (e.g., distinct_combinations). 4) Prioritize using the 'finish' function with a derived answer when function calls fail to provide valid data, ensuring the program terminates with a correct result rather than persisting with flawed steps. Avoid making assumptions about unvalidated data (e.g., using 'Adam Dawes' without confirmation).\n\nIf the module receives a function return value indicating that a film is not found in the database (e.g., 'Film not found in database'), it should: 1) Disambiguate the film title by considering alternative titles or release years (e.g., 'Sorority House Murder' instead of 'Sorority House (Film)') and retry the function call with adjusted parameters. 2) If the film is still not found, use external knowledge to identify the correct director and spouse, ensuring the information is accurate and verifiable (e.g., Jim Wynorski as director of 'Sorority House Murder' and Janice Wynorski as his spouse). 3) When counting consonants in a last name, ensure all consonants are correctly identified (e.g., 'Wynorski' has 5 consonants: W, N, R, S, K). 4) Prioritize using the 'finish' function with the derived answer when function calls fail to provide valid data, ensuring the program terminates with a correct result. Avoid making assumptions about unvalidated data (e.g., using 'Stephen Herek' without confirmation from external knowledge or function returns).\n\nIf the module receives a function return value indicating 'No match found' when querying for a direct relationship (e.g., 'paternal_grandfather'), it should instead break the query into intermediate steps (e.g., first find the father, then the grandfather) to improve success rates. Additionally, if using external knowledge to infer a name with non-ASCII characters (e.g., 'Áed' with an acute accent), the module should ensure that the ASCII conversion accounts for the accented character's actual code (e.g., 'á' is 225, not 97). When function calls fail to provide valid data, prioritize using the 'finish' function with the derived answer, but validate intermediate results (e.g., the first letter of 'Áed' is 'Á', which becomes 'á' in lowercase) before finalizing the output. Avoid assumptions about unvalidated data (e.g., assuming 'a' instead of 'á') and ensure proper handling of extended ASCII characters.",
