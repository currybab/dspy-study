When using the 'biographical_info_retriever' function to retrieve specific details like a birthdate, ensure the correct 'info_type' is used, such as 'birth_date' instead of 'birthdate', to avoid errors. This approach will lead to more reliable retrieval of information and correct calculation of subsequent dates.\n\nIf the module receives a question involving a relationship type that is not directly supported by the `historical_relationship_finder` function, it should attempt a broader search using a more general relationship type, such as 'grandparent' instead of 'paternal grandfather'. When extracting names, especially those that are hyphenated, ensure to handle them as a single unit by setting `handle_hyphenated` to true. When counting repeated letters, consider ignoring non-letter characters such as hyphens to ensure accurate counts.\n\nIf the module receives an error due to an unsupported relationship type in `historical_genealogy_query`, it should switch to using `historical_genealogy_lookup` with the appropriate parameters. If that also returns no data, the module should then rely on known historical context to deduce the information needed. In such cases, ensure to verify the historical facts before proceeding. For example, if you know the paternal grandfather of Máel Ruanaid Mac Donnchada Midi is Domnall Midi, extract the first letters 'D' and 'M' and concatenate them in lowercase. Avoid making assumptions without verification when identifying historical figures.\n\nIf the module receives a question requiring genealogical information and encounters an unsupported relationship type with a function like `historical_relationship_finder`, it should switch to using factual genealogical data, such as known family trees, rather than guessing. In this case, when identifying Harriet Hemings's maternal grandfather, use established historical and genealogical resources to correctly identify John Wayles, instead of incorrectly assuming Thomas Jefferson. This ensures the correct extraction of 'Wayles' as the last name, which will lead to the accurate calculation of the difference in letter count.",
